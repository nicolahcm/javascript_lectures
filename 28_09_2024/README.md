1. Exercise: With the help of conditional rendering, do 2 categories of product (kitchen products and food products). When we press one button we have one category of product and some of such products. When we press the other button, we get the other products.

2. We have the list 

```
let a = [7,11,4,18,9]

```

We want to get as result the list with the elements bigger or equals than 10: 

```
let result = [11,18]
```
.

3. We have the list 
```
let a = [
    {
        "name": "Mark",
        "age": 17
    }, 
    {
        "name": "Henry",
        "age": 22
    },
    {
        "name": "Luis",
        "age": 28
    }
]

```

I want to get the filtered list with the people who are older than 18 :
```
let result = [
    {
        "name": "Henry",
        "age": 22
    },
    {
        "name": "Luis",
        "age": 28
    }
]

```
